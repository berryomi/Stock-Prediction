# Topic: *Stock prediction using machine learning and Deep learning models*

## Introduction
    Stock trend analysis and prediction continuously have been a popular topic in global financial markets and technical research. There are numerous factors and conditions that determine the daily stock price, which makes the stock market a complex system of fluctuations where accurate price forecasting is challenging. There have been various attempts and studies to scientifically predict the stock price movement, but it still remains an unresolved challenge to predict the future stock values due to its natural volatility. Meanwhile, some researchers state that the stock price movements are chaotic rather than being totally random as the market is mostly dependent on the investorsâ€™ rational behaviours. This implies that future stock price predictions may be possible through the deliberate analysis of historical data with the support of various technical mechanisms. An efficient method to process such predictive analysis is machine learning or deep learning. Both techniques are in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) which provides the system to automatically learn the information to complete various technical tasks. Thus, we combine the AI and the technical data analysis to examine whether the movement in stock prices can be predicted regardless of other external factors such as the economic or social events, if only the pattern of fluctuations on the chart could be found.

## Models
 - Stock market prices are predicted by using Machine Learning Regression Models and Deep Learning Model.
    - Machine Learning Regression Models:
         - Linear Regression Model
         - K-nearest Neighbour (KNN) Regression Model
         - Random Forest Regression Model
    - Deep Learning Model:
         - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model   


## Steps

 - The data used are gathered from our crawler program (crawler.py)
    - Stock price indices used are:
        - Nasdaq (IXIC)
        - Nikkei (N225)
    - Data pre-processing includes:
        - Data Cleaning
        - Noise Filtering (Short/Long Rolling Mean)
        - Data Normalization -> MinMaxscaler
    - Build and Train Models (Machine Learning)
        - Linear Regression - Short Rolling
        - Linear Regression - Long Rolling
        - K-nearest Neighbour Regression - Short Rolling
        - K-nearest Neighbour Regression - Long Rolling
        - Random Forest Regression - Best Parameters
            - Random Forest Regression - Short Rolling
            - Random Forest Regression - Long Rolling
    - Machine Learning Models Failure Analysis
    - Build and Train Models (Deep Learning)
        - Epoch 20
        - Epoch 100
    - Model Prediction and Visaulizing the Results
    - Model Analysis 
        - RMSE compare analysis
        - Validation loss and training loss by epochs
    - Ininital model with single hidden layer with LSTM model (For model testing)
